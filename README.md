# What is Canary?

Canary is a social media networking sensation, built by four students at [Founders & Coders London][http://foundersandcoders.org/]. Canary gives the aging Twitter format a make-over with Node.js and a bright new colour scheme.

# Why are we building Canary?

We're building Canary as a learning exercise in using Node.js for large-scale projects.

# How is Canary built?

We are following these steps to build Canary:

### Step 1
[x] Make Create, Read and Delete (CR-D) endpoints
[] Store tweets as JSON in memory

### Step 2
[] Store Tweets in the file system

### Step 3
[] Use Cookies to restrict tweet deletion to the browser from which the tweet was originally created

### Step 4
[] Move Tweets to Redis

### Step 5
[] Deploy to Heroku

### Step 6
