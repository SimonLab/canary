Canary is a social media networking sensation, built by four students at [Founders & Coders London](http://foundersandcoders.org/). Canary gives the aging Twitter format a make-over with Node.js and an attractive new colour scheme.

## Why are we building Canary?

We're building Canary as a learning exercise in using Node.js for large-scale projects.

## How is Canary built?

We are following these steps to build Canary:

### Step 1
- [x] Make Create, Read and Delete (CR-D) endpoints
- [x] Store tweets as JSON in memory

### Step 2
- [x] Store Tweets in the file system

### Step 3
- [ ] Use Cookies to restrict tweet deletion to the browser from which the tweet was originally created (in progress)

### Step 4
- [ ] Move Tweets to Redis

### Step 5
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku

### Step 6
- [x] Add real-time updates of tweets

### Stretch goals
- [ ] Hash tag functionality
