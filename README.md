# Week 4: build Twitter

Canary is a social media networking sensation, built by four students at [Founders & Coders London](http://foundersandcoders.org/). Canary gives the aging Twitter format a make-over with Node.js and a bright new colour scheme.

## Why are we building Canary?

We're building Canary as a learning exercise in using Node.js for large-scale projects.

### Step 1
+ Make Create, Read and Delete (CR-D) endpoints.
+ Store your tweets as JSON in memory.

### Step 2
+ Store Tweets in the file system.

### Step 3
+ Use Cookies to restrict tweet deletion to the browser from which the tweet was originally created.

### Step 4
+ Move your Tweets to Redis

### Step 5
+ Deploy to Heroku

### Step 6
+ Add real-time updates of tweets

Depending on how much progress you make, we may start adding some stretch steps before the end of the week.

You will be expected to use everything that you have learnt so far. You will be testing on both the front end back ends and you will have something approaching a full set of repo badges https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges.
